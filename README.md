## AI-Powered Project Management with Web3 Integration

TasKing is a next-generation project management tool that seamlessly blends AI-powered task management with cutting-edge Web3 capabilities. It's designed for modern development teams, DAOs, and open-source projects that want to leverage the power of decentralization and intelligent automation.

### Key Features

*   **AI-Enhanced Task Management**: Create, assign, and track tasks with an intelligent assistant. Get AI-generated task descriptions and smart assignee recommendations based on skills and availability.
*   **Web3 Integration**: Enable gasless transactions using USDT or a custom-minted coin. A system where developers are paid based on the app's utility and coin usage (e.g., transaction fees, staking rewards). This way, developers continue to make money over time rather than upfront and are incentivized to keep building features.
*   **Project Website**: Develop a website to showcase the TasKing project management tool and its Web3 capabilities. Enable users to create project sites that can be accessed through Web3 and require ownership to control certain tasks to build a new open-source system around Kanban.
*   **DAO Governance & Smart Contracts**: A built-in module for decentralized autonomous organizations to manage proposals and voting. Smart Contracts allow governance through token payments or voting depending on company requirements, along with DAOs to provide certain utility.
*   **Intuitive Visualization**: A clean, Kanban-style board provides a clear visual overview of project progress.
*   **File Attachments & Links**: Attach files from Github, Google Drive, and external links directly to tasks.

TasKing is built to empower teams by automating workflows, fostering transparent governance, and creating a new paradigm for open-source collaboration.
