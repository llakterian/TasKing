# **App Name**: TasKing

## Core Features:

- Task Management: Create, assign, and track tasks within projects, similar to Kanboard. Also add assign user to task or project based on skills, task due dates, and user availability, which could be learned by past project and employee's perfomance as a 'tool'
- Web3 Integration: Enable gassless transactions using USDT or a custom-minted coin (investigate profitability). Implement a system where developers are paid based on the app's utility and coin usage (e.g., transaction fees, staking rewards). This way, developers continue to make money over time rather than upfront and incentivize to keep building features.
- Project Website: Develop a website to showcase the TaskForceDAO project management tool and web3 capabilities. Enable users to create project sites that can be accessed through Web3 and require ownership to control certain tasks to build a new open source system around Kanban
- Smart Contracts: Smart Contracts to allow governance through token payments or voting depending on company requirements, along with DAOs to provide certain utility. If a project gets paid into the contract or if funds get put into the contract, what will those funds do?
- Progress visualization: Visual boards that allow users to visualise project progress.
- File Attachment and Links: Attaching Files from Github, Google Drive and external link supports
